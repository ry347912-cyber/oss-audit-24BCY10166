## About This Project

This repository contains the shell scripts for the Open Source Audit capstone project. The chosen software is **Git** — the distributed version control system originally written by Linus Torvalds in 2005 after proprietary tools failed the Linux kernel community.

The audit covers Git's origin story, its GPL v2 license, ethical questions in open-source development, Git's Linux footprint, and its place in the FOSS ecosystem.

## Dependencies

All scripts run on **Ubuntu Linux**. The following must be installed:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git lsb-release -y
```

No additional Python, Node.js, or third-party tools are required.

---

## How to Run Each Script

### Setup — Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/[your-github-username]/oss-audit-[rollnumber].git
cd oss-audit-[rollnumber]
chmod +x *.sh
```

---

### Script 1 — System Identity Report

Displays a welcome screen with distro name, kernel version, logged-in user, home directory, uptime, current date/time, and the open-source license covering the OS.

```bash
./script1_system_identity.sh
```

**Expected output:** A formatted terminal display showing system information and a note about the Linux GPL v2 license.

---

### Script 2 — FOSS Package Inspector

Checks whether Git is installed on the system, displays its version and license info, and prints a philosophy note using a `case` statement.

```bash
./script2_package_inspector.sh
```

**Expected output:** Installation status, version, and a one-paragraph philosophy note about Git.

**To test with a different package**, edit line 10 in the script:
```bash
PACKAGE="git"   # change to: apache2, firefox, vlc, mysql, python3, etc.
```

---

### Script 3 — Disk and Permission Auditor

Loops through a list of important system directories and reports permissions, ownership, and disk usage. Also checks for Git's system and user config files.

```bash
./script3_disk_permission_auditor.sh
```

**Expected output:** A table of directories with their permissions and sizes, followed by a Git config directory check.

---

### Script 4 — Log File Analyzer

Reads a log file line by line, counts how many lines contain a specified keyword, and prints the last 5 matching lines.

```bash
# Basic usage — searches /var/log/syslog for "error"
./script4_log_analyzer.sh /var/log/syslog error

# Search for warnings
./script4_log_analyzer.sh /var/log/syslog warning

# Search auth log for failed login attempts
./script4_log_analyzer.sh /var/log/auth.log failed

# Run without arguments — auto-detects an available log file
./script4_log_analyzer.sh
```

**Note:** Some log files require root access. If permission is denied, run with `sudo`:
```bash
sudo ./script4_log_analyzer.sh /var/log/auth.log failed
```

---

### Script 5 — Open Source Manifesto Generator

Interactively asks you three questions and generates a personalised open-source philosophy statement, saving it to a `.txt` file.

```bash
./script5_manifesto_generator.sh
```

**Expected output:** Three prompts appear. After answering, a manifesto is generated, saved to `manifesto_[username].txt`, and printed to the terminal.

**Example interaction:**
```
1. Name one open-source tool you use every day: git
2. In one word, what does 'freedom' mean to you in software? transparency
3. Name one thing you would build and share freely with the world: a study planner
```

## Shell Concepts Used

| Script | Concepts Demonstrated |
|--------|-----------------------|
| Script 1 | Variables, `echo`, command substitution `$()`, `lsb_release`, `uname`, `whoami`, `date` |
| Script 2 | `if-then-else`, `case` statement, `dpkg -l`, `grep`, `awk`, pipe operators |
| Script 3 | `for` loop, arrays, `ls -ld`, `du -sh`, `awk`, directory existence check `[ -d ]` |
| Script 4 | `while read` loop, `if-then` inside loop, counter variables, `$1`/`$2` arguments, retry logic |
| Script 5 | `read` for user input, string concatenation, file redirection `>` and `>>`, `date`, alias concept (commented) |

---

## Notes for the Evaluator
- All scripts are tested on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS and Ubuntu 24.04 LTS.
- Scripts use `dpkg` (Debian/Ubuntu) rather than `rpm` (RHEL/Fedora) as the target system is Debian-based.
- Script 4 includes a retry loop if the log file is not immediately found, and gracefully handles empty files.
- Every non-obvious line in each script includes an inline comment explaining what it does.
- Script 5 demonstrates the alias concept via a comment block, as aliases are shell-session constructs and cannot be meaningfully embedded in a non-interactive script.
